# A variable is the name given to a memory location in a program.
# It is used to store data values.

a = 22          # 'a' is a variable that stores an integer value
b = "Harsh"     # 'b' is a variable that stores a string value
c = 22.2        # 'c' is a variable that stores a float value

# Note:
# - 'Keywords' are reserved words in Python like 'if', 'for', 'while', etc.
# - 'Identifiers' are the names given to variables, functions, classes, etc.

# Reassigning new values to variables
a = 1           # assigning integer 1 to variable 'a'
b = 2           # assigning integer 2 to variable 'b'

# Printing the sum of variables a and b
print(a + b)    # Output: 3
