Donkeys (also known as asses) are intelligent, social, and resilient members of the horse family, characterized by their long ears, strong build, and cautious nature, which often leads to their undeserved reputation for stubbornness. They are known for their exceptional memory, ability to form strong social bonds, and unique communication methods including braying that can be heard from miles away.
