# Printing numbers from 1 to 5 using individual print statements
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)

# The same task can be done more efficiently using a loop:
# Using a for loop with the range() function to print numbers from 1 to 5
for x in range(1, 6):  # range(1, 6) generates numbers from 1 to 5 (6 is excluded)
  print(x)             # print each number in the range
